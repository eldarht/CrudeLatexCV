\maketitle

\section*{Interest areas}
Within the field of computer science, I would like to write computer programs with a focus on problem solving. Preferably on code that provide functionality with a well defined and unambiguous goal, where the input and output is well defined and assumptions about the end-users behaviour does not change the implementation. This could be back-end development, library functions, data-interpretation, sensor-functionality, complex algorithms or similar. I have tried several languages and could work with any of them, but i prefer compiled languages with type safety and a strict syntax.
